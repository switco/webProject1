# webProject1

My first HTML/CSS project, that i've realised back in november 2019.

## Rules

I was on charge of creating a brand, with a whole identity, and realize the homepage of the website, using exclusively HTML and CSS. For this purpose, i had to follow a detailed specification brief.

## Documentation

You can find every documentation that i've made in the documentation folder. 
To design the homepages (Desktop & Mobile), i've used the software Figma.
