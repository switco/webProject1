# webProject1

My first HTML/CSS project, entirely created by me.

# Rules

I was on charge of creating a brand, with a whole identity, and realize the homepage of the website, using exclusively HTML and CSS. For this purpose, i had to follow a detailed specification brief.

# Documentation

You can find every documentation that i've made in the documentation file. 
To design the homepages (Desktop & Mobile), i've used the software Figma.
